          "description": "Add progressive speed increase logic to the game state management. Introduce a speed multiplier state variable that increases at timed intervals during active gameplay. Apply the multiplier to the bird's vertical velocity calculations. Ensure the speed multiplier resets to 1.0 when the game restarts after a collision. Implement interval-based speed tier increases (e.g., every 10-15 seconds of gameplay). Maintain existing collision detection, jumping mechanics, and pipe generation while incorporating the speed scaling factor."

Position the indicator in a non-obstructive location (top-right or top-left corner). Implement a brief visual notification or highlight effect when the speed tier increases (e.g., a fade-in animation or color pulse). Style the indicator to be clearly visible but not distracting from the core gameplay area. Update the display whenever the speed multiplier changes."
