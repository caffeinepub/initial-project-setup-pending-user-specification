  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements. REQ-1 is implemented with a progressive speed multiplier that affects bird velocity and pipe speed, increasing every 10 seconds. REQ-2 is implemented with a visual speed indicator and temporary speed-up notifications. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",

    {
      "description": "Speed multiplier also affects pipe movement speed in addition to bird velocity",
      "reason": "REQ-1 specifically requests bird vertical velocity increases, but the implementation also multiplies pipe speed (PIPE_SPEED * speedMultiplierRef.current). This extends beyond the stated requirement which focuses on bird velocity only.",

      "reason": "The requirement states speed increases gradually over time but does not specify a maximum cap. The implementation adds this constraint which was not requested.",
