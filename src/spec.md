# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Implement progressive difficulty increase by gradually speeding up the bird's vertical velocity over time.

**Planned changes:**
- Add mechanism to progressively increase bird's vertical velocity at regular intervals during gameplay
- Add visual feedback showing current speed level or multiplier
- Display notification when speed tier changes
- Reset speed to initial value when game restarts after collision

**User-visible outcome:** The game becomes progressively harder as the bird moves faster over time, with a visible speed indicator showing the current difficulty level.
